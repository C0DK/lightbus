!!! note "If you get stuck..."

    It is really useful to hear from people who have encountered a problem 
    or got stuck. Hearing from you means we can improve our documentation 
    and error messages.
    
    **If you get stuck drop then please drop an email to adam@adamcharnock.com, 
    visit the [Lightbus discord server](https://discord.gg/2j594ws), or call me (Adam) on 
    +442032896620.** 
    
    The more information 
    you can include the better (problem description, screenshots, and code are all useful)
