# Schema protocol (Redis)

Here we document the specific interactions between Lightbus and Redis. 
The concrete implementation of this is provided by the `RedisScehamTransport` class.

This documentation may be useful when debugging, developing third-party client libraries, 
or simply for general interest and review. **You do not need to be aware of this 
protocol in order to use Lightbus**.
