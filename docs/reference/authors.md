## Thanks

Lightbus would not have been possible without the intellectual, emotional, and logistical support 
of the following individuals and companies:

* [Louis Thibault](https://github.com/lthibault) 
    – For helping Adam work through many of the knottier problems, and relentlessly cheering him on.
* [Futurepump](https://futurepump.com/)
    – For being an early testing ground and ongoing user of Lightbus.
* [Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil) 
    – For being an early sounding board, and persuading Adam to take schemas seriously.

Additional thanks to everyone (technical and non-technical) who kindly listened to Adam 
talk about the reasons and ideas behind Lightbus.
