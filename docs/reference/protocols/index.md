# Protocols

Here we define the specific interactions between Lightbus and its underlying 
communication medium, Redis. The intention is to provide enough information to allow 
services written in other languages to interact with Lightbus.

* [Event protocol (Redis)](event.md)
* [RPC & result protocol (Redis)](rpc-and-result.md)
* [Schema protocol (Redis)](schema.md)
