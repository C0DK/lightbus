    The simplest implementation should simply be capable of:

        1. Consuming all events
        2. Sending events

    However, consuming all events will probably be unnecessary in most situations.
    You can therefore selectively listen for events by implementing
    ``start_listening_for()`` and ``stop_listening_for()``.

    Implementing these methods will have several benefits:

      * Will reduce resource use
      * Will allow for dynamically changing listened-for events at runtime
